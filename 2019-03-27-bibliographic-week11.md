I enjoyed reading the Klein and D'Ignazio's Introduction, finding it both informative as valuably accessible to a wide range of audiences. Key in this introduction was the idea that feminism does not only regard women; with interesectionality in mind, feminism is invested in all forms of power relation. When it comes to data, power can be exterted in multiple directions. It can be used to support, to suppress, to sell, and more, as the authors outline, but is almost always enmeshed in prior power systems that are worth investigating. The notion of "data feminism" relates to this, focusing on the personal connections to data that unseat them as purely "objective" and force one to think about both the people behind the data collection and visualization processes and the people and systems represented or even created by the data itself. I found it interesting that data feminism too, per the author's formulation, is committed to action; so much data, it seems, is relegated to libraries of nothingness - or is it that data becomes data when it is used in a particular way, giving all true data a particular tilt by virtue of this usage?

Chapter One: Bring Back The Bodies, was similarly insightful, emphasizing the real world impacts of data practices, and the impact of the real world on data software. A multitude of issues arose - captialist misuse of data that infringes of privacy, technical systems created with gender and racial biases, and invisibility of visualization creators enabled by "the god trick" (as Haraway describes) of visualizations themselves. The authors don't provide a specific overarching solution for these issues, largely because there isn't one, but instead propose a reframing in the search for solutions to focus on larger social issues rather than on individuated ones. I was left wondering what impetus we can provide for the powerful large corporations who (mis)use data for their own benefit to integrate these social-structure oriented change practices. I feel that often the "ethics" choices these corporations make are motivated by their need to look good in the public eye in order to maintain profitability; blaming individuals within the company for "bias" enables the company to assume the guise about doing something about the issues in which they (and their profitability) are complicit without actually doing anything at all. How can we motivate those in power to move toward the somewhat seismic shifts that need to be pursued in data sciences?
