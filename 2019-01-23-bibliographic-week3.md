"Baxter's Procutes" was both an amusing and revealing satirical read. The emphasis throughout was on the book as a decorative object conveying status and taste through its formatting decisions, rather than on its actual contents, as Professor Cordell touched upon in our last class. The author clearly shows the folly of this viewpoint when the club's most valued book, which each member reviews without having read, proves to be devoid of text. And yet, this lack of text eventually turns out to be a desirable feature, increasing the monetary (and in the context of the story, social) value of the book. In this sense, "Baxter's Procutes" emphasizes the appeal of novelty and difference, and how uptake of an object may defeat the original intentions of its creator - who in this case, aspired to make the other members of the club look foolish.

The first Johanna Drucker chapter provides a brief overview of book history and bibliography as a field in the past forty years, but more significantly, makes a push for "biblio-alterity," a practice of book history that refuses comparative approaches in favor of situating objects in their own unique semiotic frameworks. This different approach draws on many of the techniques of prior approaches, but vitally, does not take Western progression, or the codex, for granted or as a norm. Viewing semiotic objects in their own contexts and non-comparatively is a concept I find challenging, though clearly ethical and more "accurate." The difficulty lies in distancing oneself from one's own view, informed as that view is by one's own language and communication formats. I think this perspective shift is aided by Mignolo's call for a form of self-reflexivity, in the attention not only to objects, but discourse surrounding objects; it may be easier to find cultural biases in the work of another, then filter one's own work for those biases, than find them in one's own work initially.

The second chapter builds on these ides to suggest not only that we investigate bibliographic objects with a uniform, rather that "us" vs. "them" field, but that we analyze communicative methods in the context of the systems that generate them. Legible objects, events, and systems are only legible through certain dynamics, and these dynamics must be parsed, rather than taken for granted, for de-colonial work to be done in bibliography. We must analyze semiotic formats performatively, rather than in their objecthood - sometimes, there may not even be a material object.

Darnton's "'What is the History of Books?' Revisited" provides an interesting overview of the early years of the field, as well as some fascinating examples from French book history. Darnton emphasizes the degree to which, in book history, everything is connection; each book is a product of a vast network of different people and practices inextricable from each other, including some things we'd find idiosyncratic today, like the weather, paper quality, and ability to hedge bets by publishing works made by other presses. The latter element I found fascinating, sensible, and revealing. With copyright not what it is today, the logical thing to do is diversify your book portfolio so you are safe from the risk of publishing multiple flops. Reading Darnton after Drucker was interesting, as he is definitely limited in scope in a way that she condemns, referring to Iceland (which is itself a European nation) as alter to the standard, a fluke rather than an equally viable alternative, or one kept on its own basis.

The Introduction to How To Do Things With Books in Victorian Britain struck me in its overview of classed notions of reading. As literacy became accessible to the broader public, certain types of reading became favorable to the wealthy, who came to privilege the text over the book, despite the great lexicon regarding material treatment of the book that occurred. Qualities of books and usages of books came to stand for traits of individual personalities. There is also a strong notion of books as mediating relationships in the introduction - both in their "circulation" and in their "handling," each component necessary for one to begin "reading." The author hopes to recover the material histories and experiences of books that have been so often derided by the hegemonic forces of the time, because, as she argues, those experiences of the book were equally valid and impactful, and often those not of the privileged classes were more aware of such dynamics.

The first chapter of How to Do Things With Books focuses on how "nontextual" and "noninterpretive" uses of books have often gone unnoticed in book history scholarship. As the author cleverly puts it, "Is book history a subset of textual interpretation or vice versa?" Indeed, the field can be widened farther, as many fields  beyond book history purport to "read" their objects of study, books or not; while, on the other end, some who study books are desperately (and, Price seems to suggest, errantly) looking wholly elsewhere. These latter folks, Price declares, are "petty," "privilege the mundane over the ideal," and "integrate descriptions of material ideals with generalizations about social institutions." In other words, material has been used as a metonymic and metaphorical linked to the social. That said, in the Victorian era, "good" readers were blissfully unaware of the material nature of what they read, and instead engrossed by the words themselves. If these ideas seem a little meandering, it's because the chapter itself is rather meandering. It's hard for me to put a tack on what it's main point is, with the writing so awash with examples from differing time periods. That said, Price eventually states that "my question is how to situation literary interpretations vis-a-vis the social life of books more broadly understood."

I was rather disappointed with "The Aesthetic of Bookishness in Twenty-first Century Literature." While I agree with Pressman that books are foregrounding their formal and format qualities more than ever in a justification of their capabilities in the current diverse media environment, postulating that all aestheticization of books is a response to the digital is reductive. Pressman advocates for escaping dichotomies of "book vs. digital" but she herself engages in the strict binary of "book *and* digital," failing to see that books can and have operate and experiment independently of digital spaces. While her one example is interesting, though a bit absurdly on-the-nose, it does not provide the basis for the breadth of such claims, particularly when there are so many *other* genres and kinds of books, novels included, that insist on their book-ness in non-digitally (at least in a direct sense) responsive ways and that further emphasize the strength of the book as format, rather than using the content of the book to applaud the format (Pressman's focus on this weakens her argument). Contemporary experimental graphic novels, art books, and even popular works like *Extremeley Loud and Incredibly Close* all integrate the book format into their meaning and experience, expressing the unique vitality of the book in the digital age, without need for cyber-sharks and houses made of books (gag). As a last note, I disagree that digital media conceives of information as independent of container. While there is crossover between both physical and digital platform contents, there is a unique experience tied to different digital platforms, influenced by a wide variety of factors. I think that perspective is Pressman's piece is more a victim of time and development rather than faulty reasoning.
