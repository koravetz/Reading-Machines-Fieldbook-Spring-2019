McGill's piece "A Matter of the Text" is an interesting look into the ways reprint culture destabilizes the primacy of the author. McGill points to the need to recognize reprint culture as its own thing, rather than as the aberration it has traditionally been conceived of as. Part of this means acknowledging the relation between format, circulation, and form and text itself, including not only the ways in which a "print culture" per se of the time may have restricted texts, but enabled them - an approach contrary to other scholars. This culture also meant a shifting notion of the literary that McGill traces throughout her book, manifested both through copyright law (or lack thereof) and book form itself. I found McGill's discussion of gift books fascinating, as she dives into how, in part by virtue of technology, image and text were separate, rather than interactive, as they are often studied. I find myself wondering whether this is so only in the context of one who is aware of the means of their production, or whether they may have still engaged in a joint relationship, in part by virtue of their shared space within the codex. I was also intrigued by how McGill structured her book, which is in many ways anti-author, around famous authors. It seems she did so out of bibliographic necessity, which is a fascinating indicator of limits to the discourse established by overwhelming and marginalizing traditions.

Ridolfo and DeVoss's exploration of rhetorical velocity may be (fittingly enough) dated in some ways, but the base ideas it is built upon are more relevant than ever. In some ways the contemporary Internet is built upon compositions created with rhetorical velocity in mind. Certain file formats allow videos, images, gifs, and text to run rampant throughout different platforms. Meme templates are pervasive, and generate excitement around their ease of iterability via photo editing software and their accompanying potential for specific relatability. News articles are given headlines most likely to proliferate. However, as McGill emphasizes, this proliferation of recomposition is not wholly a modern thing; reprint culture also entailed a wide spreading of texts across formats and contexts, in a similar process that also decentralized the author and shed light on the producer of the specific framework the content was embedded in. One must wonder to what degree rhetorical velocity played a conscious role in composition even in a less networked age, where the average citizen was far less empowered to proliferate medias. 

Cordell and Mullen's piece on fugitive verses was fascinating in multiple respects. On a basic level, the history of the virality of "Beautiful Snow" is quite interesting, especially in the parallel to meme culture today (whereby parody plays a significant role in the re-emergence and recirculation of certain texts, i.e. Bee Movie), and in how, though immensely popular and almost idiomatic in its time, it has faded from scholarly knowledge. This latter aspect signals to me how comprehensive digital archives may be useful, now and in the future, for revealing works obscured by categorizations of taste and literariness. I also find intriguing the notion of investigating or characterizing texts as a series of bibliographic events happening within networks, creating multiple contexts for and of the text that essentially re-make it into a new text each time. In this sense, this article continues this week's trend of turning away from the author in favor of attention to circulated context. Reading fugitive verses themselves, specifically "Beautiful Snow", "The Children", and "A Fragment Found in a Skeleton Case", I was struck by their rhythmic simplicity, as commented upon in the article. I also found Skeleton Case interesting in how, even in its pure textual content, it borrows heavily from *Hamlet*, enacting a form of "fugivitivity." 

I enjoyed browsing the collection of Twitter text bots, and thought they connect in interesting way to the discussions of authorship and velocity in the readings this week. Text generated by a bot may either be considered authorless, as the bot has no intent outside of its set constraints in creating the piece, or authored due to those constraints. Text generated by a bot might also be considered authored by the person who created the bot itself. However, in the Twitterverse, such authorship is occluded by things like retweets, avatars, and limited bio space, complicating the issue further. I most enjoyed the bots that engaged in generating texts through modifications to pre-existing text, such as the humorously capitalist dystopian Two Headlines, which mashes together random headlines with often surprisingly prescient and wittily poetic results. This bot engages with the intense velocity of Twitter news to create new and pseudo-relevant news bits. It's fascinating that something without a human humorist brain composing its individual tweets can still land on things we find amusing with some regularity - though it might also be said that part of the pleasure of experiencing this bot, and the others, is the novel knowledge that they are bots, measuring their pitfalls and victories against the (assumed superior) capacities of human authors. It's fascinating too to see what people choose to follow - notably, everyword and tiny stars - which may be indicative of how people experience the platform, as much as of the quality of those bots themselves.
