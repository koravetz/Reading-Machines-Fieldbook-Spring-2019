The "Ramble with Mrs. Grundy" revealed some interesting gender dynamics of its time. Perhaps most notably, the piece generally proposes that women were seen as fit to be compositors, but not press operators, in large part because of the physical demands of the latter. In some ways, this piece suggests, this fitness to compose undermined proto-feminist writing itself, as such women's writing was not specifically beneficial to the practical situation of women when compositing is seen as something a woman could do on *any* publication, not just one for women. This emphasis on the practical, on the ability of women's writing to improve the condition of women, not just through ideas and influence, but through practice and employment, is fascinating. It makes me think about current feminist projects who endeavor both to create feminist texts and support women's labor in underrepresented fields - music artist Grimes's last tour and album, which involved only female talent, stands out to me. Does a feminist project have to integrate female labor to be feminist? Is a feminist project that uses only female labor not feminist at all?

I found the ending of the "Women Compositors" piece quite interesting. In response to any doubters of women's ability to print, the Queen seems to have commissioned a compilation of esteemed authors to be printed by the Victoria Press. It's interesting to think about this from a modern perspective - in some senses, a collection of work by mostly male authors nowadays would seem patriarchal, if anything, as we pay little heed to who printed the texts we read. In those times, however, printers were much more visible, and those male authors would serve in a sense to validate the work of the Victoria Press through their inclusion, leveraging their gendered power to help women. I also found revealing the way wage deflation is discussed. It's not that proposing that women working would cause wages to decrease is ethically wrong (as it would be construed today), but rather practically wrong - as the author argues, it simply wouldn't happen. 

"Finding Women in the Printing Shop" emphasizes the importance of digging into historical sources to discover the ways women contributed, as their contributions are often written out of history. I connect this form of research to the need for meditative engagement and thought called for by some feminist rhetoricians. Slowly dwelling upon the artifact of study, and not just the text of the artifact, allows one to consider all of the hands that contribute to all of the work needed for the artifact, including women that could have been involved. I also think back to my work with the WWP, wherein I encountered many early modern publishers and authors whose names were solely denoted by initials. I now wonder what percentage of those people may have been women, their names obscured by gendered dynamics of the time - why would it be necessary for women to go by their initials in these contexts?
