In this lab, I created a Github account and downloaded a Markdown text editor, in the process learning what Github as a medium permits and how to use Markdown to create text files. Both Github and Markdown Edit, my medium of choice for fieldwork entry, facilitate enhanced functionality in textual editing and submission.
