In this lab, I created a Github account and downloaded a Markdown text editor, in the process learning what Github as a medium permits and how to use Markdown to create text files. Both Github and Markdown Edit, my medium of choice for fieldwork entry, facilitate enhanced functionality in textual editing and submission.

Github is a platform for sharing code and documents through upload to a shared repository. A major affordance of Github is the ability to revert to prior editions of uploaded files, which is invaluable when it comes to collaborative coding projects (which we will likely engage in later in class). In this sense Github uniquely uses its digitality to build on the possibilities of an archive; in the pre-digital era, such mass iterative storage would be time, resource, and space intensive, not to mention difficult to access. Github's digitality also facilitates easy submission of class assignments, functioning in a McLuhan-ian sense as an extension or acceleration of the hand and legs, as an immediate delivery mechanism. Registering for and installing the Github client was a relatively straightforward process.

Markdown Edit, the program used to create the text files uploaded to Github for this class and lab, permits rapid textual formatting once the user gains familiarity with its language. For instance, surrounding a word with double asterisks (**) bolds that word, which is arguably a more streamlined and less hypermediated process than clicking a bold button (though I believe it could be argued that using a ctrl+b shortcut, by virtue of its shared presence on the keyboard, is of equal stature in terms of textual distance.) Moreover, markup, the language in which text is encoded in Markup Edit, is widely compatible with multiple other digital platforms, facilitating transportation and conversion between different useful formats. Installing Markup Edit was also a streamlined process - the key step was to ensure that files saved in Markup Edit are saved into the folder that Github shares to the repository. 

Why did we do this lab? Why are we doing our Fieldwork journals in Markup and submitting them to Github, when other platforms are available? To my mind, it is because using Github and Markup makes us cognizant of the media platforms/formats that enable communication in a manner that a more familiar medium, to which we may have been blinded by its peresistent presence as Giterlman alludes to, would disallow. In this sense, the class integrates the notion of practice being an important component of academic work, as Hayles and Pressman advocate, by foregrounding the practice that *is* academic writing. Our weekly critique and reflection does not exist in a textual vacuum, but rather is integrated into a conscious, creative experience of media through the use of these less-familiar mediums.
