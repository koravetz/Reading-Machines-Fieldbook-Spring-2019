Melville's "The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids" is filled with his distinctively rich description. The tale emphasized the striking contrast between the luxurious, comfortable life of men of letters and the dreadful, work-filled life of the women who enable that livelihood by making paper. Melville describes contemporary paper making processes with vividly despairing imagery, the maids withering away to blankness, subdued by great, grinding machinery in a grim valley given the Devil's name. It's interesting to think about whether this is a proto-feminist tale despairing the fates of women, or if Melville is here using the maids to amplify the depravity of paper-making processes, to further emphasize the lowliness of the place from which, in many senses, the great luxury and wisdom of the upper-class bachelors comes. For it is the material, Melville recognizes, that permits a lifestyle and an image, as he describes how the Templars go from wearing restrictive armor to more flexible and delicate leather, from swords to quills. 

Senchyne's "Paper Nationalism" was a fascinating, well-crafted read that really tied together many of the readings from this week and last. The idea that paper served to establish communities, not only or even primarily through what was written on it, but through its actual material construction, composed of mixed rags collected from a mixed populace, resonates with the notion that upper class Victorians would disregard the material nature of a text in favor of its contents. Doing so is a symbolic act distancing oneself from the laborers, women, minorities, and other "undesirables" whose material conditions and labor are embedded in the book itself. "Paper Nationalism" also further enlightens and contextualizes Melville's "Paradise of Bachelors" as a "technotext" which comments, in a sense, on the Victorian dynamic. The upper class (or at least, upper class aspiring) narrator is deeply shook by witnessing the material conditions of paper creation in part because he shudders to associate with such rabble. It is not only that paper permits the luxury and wisdom of the upper class through what is written on it, but that the upper class bachelors are linked to the lower class maids through the material paper itself - giving the story a subtle (and in some senses dark) sexual undercurrent. The paper is the medium through which the bachelor and the maid copulate, in a certain sense, the medium through which they are unified despite their vast differences.

I was intrigued by Bonnie Mak's Introduction to How the Page Matters, and it left me wanting more (perhaps as part of my Field and Focus work?) While her overview of the material processes of different forms of page making were largely covered by Borsuk in *The Book*, I appreciated her later insights into the importance of page layout. The ways in which font, blank space, page material, and decoration impact reader experience, affect, and knowledge are all key components of formalist comics studies, and I couldn't help but think of *House of Leaves* as I was reading. One thing I found Mak neglected in her introduction, however, was how the the decision to put information on one page rather than another, or to break text or images across consecutive pages, can affect the reading experience. Perhaps this is because her emphasis is on singular pages, which can occur outside of codex and other grouped contexts, but I feel like that is a vital element to consider when studying the page when it is grouped with other pages.

Reading the Lisa Gitelman chapter on pdfs from *Paper Knowledge*, I found myself agreeing with her focal point, emphasizing not just how formats are developed and circulate, but how they "manifest and reciprocally help shape cultural values." In my limited readings on digital media formats, I have been puzzled by the occasional if not commonplace focus on reading the code at the base of formats and platforms. While this form of reading is not an invalid activity, I find it to be divorced from the experience 99%+ of users of the platform actually have, from the way in which the platform actually impacts their experience, at least by one level of mediation. Thus, speaking more directly about how the out-facing elements of a format impact the user seems to me a more fruitful endeavor (though of course, those out-facing elements are rooted in inward decisions and constraints). For instance, Gitelman discusses how PDFs "insulate reading from authoring," both manifesting and maintaining the hierarchies of control and reception present in many workplaces (and even the academy).
