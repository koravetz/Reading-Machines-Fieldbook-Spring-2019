For this lab, I composed lead type-sorts as practice for later printing exercises. The composition process was and is highly spatialized, embodied, and material. First, the compositor must have a manuscript of what he is to compose. Creating new writing directly into the composing stick is a recipe for disaster, as putting the sorts into the stick in the proper order requires a conscious effort that would derail any attempt at original composition (in our contemporary sense of the term). After selecting a font to use, the compositor takes the corresponding tray for that font and place it on a large, level surface. Then, the compositor takes the composing stick, sets it to the proper length for the lines which he will compose, inserts a thin metal sheet on which to place the sorts, and begins placing sorts in, corresponding to the manuscript, upside down and backwards. Typically, the composing stick is held in such a manner that gravity prevents the sorts from shifting or falling out. In this lab, I managed to compose two lines of a poem, in what I imagine was roughly twenty minutes. 

Having done this brief but somewhat arduous lab, I better understand Gitelman’s argument that “print culture” should not focus on authors, publishers, and readers, but rather on the print shop and print materials themselves. While the ephemerality of most of what was (and is) printed supports her claim, so too does the actual embodied printing experience. Engaging in small talk with classmates while printing and struggling with the limitations and complications of composing upside down with tiny metal blocks formed a sort of cultural experience, one that felt like a more genuine “print” or at least “printing” culture than that imagined around a certain variety of print objects. The fact that all printed texts, regardless of class of contents, would go through the same process serves as a great equalizer for said texts; the composing process would be more or less the same for a Bible and a prostitution advertisement. How else can one justly define anything other than by that which is a constant unifier? In the case of such divergent textual contents, the production process - composing and printing - can be in some senses the only true unifying process that could rightly and accurately be dubbed print culture.

While I was struck by how long it took to compose such a small amount of writing, I also recognize the greater efficiency that sorts provided at the time. It may have been that transcribing texts by hand by candlelight during Lab 2 was quicker, but doing so has limitations. Hand-written texts cannot be reprinted like a text composed in sorts can, nor do they have the graphical regularity of a font, while enables easy reading. And while composing using sorts took a long time for me, that was likely because I was unfamiliar with the process. I very much liken the sorts drawer to a keyboard, with its strategic arrangement of letters, spaces, and punctuation marks that permit a compositor to quickly compose lines of text once he is familiar with the interface. 

Having now set type myself, I will be better able to see the embodiment and persons behind early printed books. It also emphasizes the great investment that printing a book entailed, in time, resources, and labor. As Ryan mentioned in class, it took on average 18 months to print a book, and while that was in part because other projects were of a higher priority financially, it was likely also because printing hundreds of pages of prose would be an extremely arduous process. In that sense, books had real power and importance just by virtue of being books; a book’s existence in the printing press era, particular in the early Americas with its limited number of printers (as Franklin makes clear) meant that someone deemed a book a high enough priority to actually get it made in the face of its exhaustive and exhausting requirements. This lab also made me think about the relative virtuosity of printing in certain contexts. Working for the WWP, I’ve encountered many elaborate title pages in early modern texts. The elegance of these pages not only served to emphasize the quality of the book’s contents, but the skill of the printers, who, in order to make those pages, had to nimbly use multiple font sizes, spacers, and ornamentations. The more skilled the printer could make himself seem, the more valuable and desirable the book would be, both in terms of content, and in terms of precision in execution.
