Working by candlelight really enlightens the way lighting limited the ways certain books could be experienced. While writing on an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper, or reading a roughly octavo-sized book is feasible by the light of a single candle, reading a folio-sized tome would be nearly impossible. Thus, folio-sized tomes were largely held by institutions and individuals that could afford and accommodate large lighting setups and/or were kept more for the value of their opulent object-hood, rather than their contents. It follows that the contents of folio-sized books would appeal to these audiences and situations, rather than to the poorer, common man, materially unable as he would be to read it.

Writing by candlelight also emphasized the bodily and temporal labor that went into transcription. It takes an incredible amount of time to accurately transcribe a text by hand, particularly if one is attentive to matching things like line breaks, text sizing, and pagination. Transcribing takes longer still when considering the bodily costs, the aches and pains that come with using a pencil (or quill) for long stretches of time. The flickering, indeterminate candlelight does not help either, making it more difficult to read that which one is transcribing. Many of these aspects of transcription I "knew" on a certain level, but the material experience of engaging in transcription rendered the knowledge upon my body in a way that abstraction could not. The true costs of a book exceeded that of money or the labor of others to encompass the painful labor of myself.

I am extensively interested in graphic novels as a format, and coming into this lab report, knew that the format and indeed the narrative capacities of mass produced graphic novels was expanded by the introduction of new forms of color printing (Johanna Drucker has an excellent essay that touches upon this, in some aspects defining the comic as tied to this printing capacity). However, I am further intrigued by a particular type of printing used by many underground and independent comics-art publishers and artists: risograph printing. 

Risograph printing makes sense for these publishers because of its low cost and relative ease of use - it is more reliable and quicker than a photocopier, but substantially cheaper than a laser printer or commercial lithograph printer. Risograph printed comics often use a constrained variety of vibrant colors, with a strong emphasis on deliberate design, style, and layering in addition to said color. This styling comes from the constraints of the printing process itself, as risograph printers only print one color at a time that must then be deliberately layered, limiting the number of colors that can be reasonably contained in a single artifact, and demanding attention to color layering in the initially created work itself. Further, Risograph printing often occurs with minor errors, and with a noticeably "printed" quality, granting "riso" artifacts a DIY, handcrafted quality that many independent creators value. With all of these factors in mind, risograph comics can be considered in many ways inextricable from the technology that births them. For many artists, the limitations of risograph are an opportunity for creative expressions within a new paradigms, forcing new considerations for design, and accompanying it, narrative.
