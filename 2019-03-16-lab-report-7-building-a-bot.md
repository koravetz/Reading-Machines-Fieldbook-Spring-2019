Both literally and figuratively, readers often make sense of cultural scraps through arrangement. When dealing with cultural scraps, readers can sometimes in this sense be authors, as scrapbookers like Garvey describe arrange favored passages in juxtapositions on pages, or in juxtapositions with pages. In other cases, writers other than that of the cultural scrap itself can serve as arrangers, prefixing the scrap with details governing its reading and relevance, such as the case with “Lincoln’s Favorite Poem” and “Beautiful Snow” that Cordell and Mullen describe. Arrangement can also occur robotically, or computationally, in the digital age, as both the Twitter bots in the Penumbral readings and the construction of our own Twitter bots in class elucidated. These arrangements, reliant on taking a cultural ruleset and/or scrap and tweaking it through somewhat random but constrained permutations, yields results that are sometimes functional as readable texts and other times toeing the line of gibberish. 

But what determines whether something is read as “coherent” vs. “gibberish” in these cases of cultural scraps? To me, this case be described figuratively through arrangement. Memes both digital and pre-digital appeal to us in part through recognition. When presented with scrap text that is familiar, either through past experience with its contents (either directly, like a copypasta or reference, or indirectly, like a stereotypical tale ala the contents of many 18th century gift books), or past experience with its formal dynamics (i.e. grammar), readers can use that recognition to arrange the scrap within its present context in order to give it meaning or function. I say function because sometimes these arranged scrap texts do not mean as much as they “do” - say, for instance, serving as a symbol of love, or making us laugh at the ridiculousness of computational poetics, perhaps a little defensively.

In this sense, repetition plays a key role, allowing recognition to occur as one sees prior content in a new setting. Analogously, a comic needs to have recurring characters or at least marks in order to make narrative sense (though some comics certainly play with this). A repeated drawing allows one to determine a spatial-temporal relation in that format; in the case of scrap texts, a repeated bit enables the reader to make stronger connections. However, novelty also plays a key role in the proliferation and arrangement of scrap texts. Only the most pretentious (or boring) comic reader would want to read a comic that presents the exact same image over and over again. Similarly, it’s hard to justify reprinting “Beautiful Snow” without providing a novel spin on its authorship which might entice readers who have otherwise seen the poem before, or even parodying its contents. Novelty provides the spark of newness, the intrigue that draws us toward such memetic texts.

In these contexts, circulation is not merely the physical circulation of a material object, like a book through a library system, but the movement of ideas throughout multiple permutations and contexts. In a sense, more than being like the book, circulation here is like the checkout stamp - an original idea which leaves its mark or image in many places, each a little different, for the stamp by virtue of the pressure applied, the date stamped, and the book stamped in, the scrap text by virtue of the context it is positioned in and the way it is copied (as McKenzie reminds us). Focusing on these scrap texts that are more clearly circulated in differentiating contexts, with accompanying changes in meaning and doing, reminds us that all texts function, to a degree, in this manner; that depending on the social, political, economic, cultural, environmental, material, individual, etc. position a text is put in, it can and will mean and do very different things. A text can not be justly “understood” if it is not understood in the specific context of its experience - which means, in many cases, a text can not be wholly “understood” at all.
