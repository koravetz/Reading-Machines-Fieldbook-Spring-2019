Meredith's McGill's piece "Format" raises important issues that scholars of media, and those from literature backgrounds in particular, must consider but rarely do (I at times thought that people during the romance novel activity were pointing more toward textual qualities rather than qualities of the format-medium). Physical format is a conscious decision made by publishers (and sometimes creators) to address certain hypothetical audiences. Further, that format has ramifications for reading experience, associated affect, and gained meaning. Thus, digital remediation of texts entail the loss of qualities indicative of their circulation and initial publication goals, but I would also add, of their meaning-experience. Relatedly, I appreciated McGill's warning that "Print" does not denote a specific individual format that can universally converted and understood in one way. Even within my field of graphic narrative, authors have such taught control over their format, as it is integral to the narrative and affectual experience of the book, that they widely experiment with different formatting decisions, ranging from size, to material, to color, to uniformity. 

Octave Uzanne's text is both prescient and absurd. Uzanne in some sense engages in the fallacy that media will wholly "die," as discussed in class. However, in another sense, he develops the idea that media leads to other media - one could argue that the "book" is not really dead if it is merely converted to audio. In other words, the medium that is the book-text, say, the novel, remains, while the medium that is the format, the cover, pages, etc. that Uzanne pays so much attention to, disappears in favor of auditory modes. The auditory experiences he describes are at times predictive of radio, particularly in those sections describing journalism. The section in which his companion discusses the iterative nature of painting also was provocatively prescient. Overall, both men, and in the course the author, demonstrate the fallacy and impossibility of true media death, with a sharp focus on format and material.

The first chapter of Amaranth Borsuk's *The Book* focuses on the development of the book as an object. Throughout, Borsuk emphasizes that it was not only audience and purpose that dictated the format of the developing book, but vice versa, as the format of the book had striking ramifications on audience, purpose, content, and even modes and potentialities of knowledge. The development of the contemporary codex was a transnational process wherein multiple formats and materials, initially developed independently, informed each other. Borsuk emphasizes how these formats, as other course authors have noted, did not immediately or often wholly replace each other, but rather gradually evolved, overlapped, and gained in or faded from favor, in part due to the cultural circumstances and material necessities surrounding them.

The "Afterword on Platform Studies," provides a brief overview of the five levels on which studies of digital media have focused: reception/operation, interface, form/function, code, and platform, the last of which is the authors' main focus in the book as a whole. The authors emphasize that each level is strongly impacted by cultural contexts, but I find it equally interesting to note how each level may impact cultural contexts itself, as the other readings for this week have emphasized. For my purposes, reception/operation, interface, and narratological form are of greatest interest to me; a past paper I wrote on a narrative board game dealt particularly with reception and form, but interface, as someone interested in visuality, is something I want to investigate further.

Farewell ETAOIN SHRDLU really emphasized the physicality of "old school" printing forms. The newspaper did not appear out of thin air, but was creating from a crunching, gnashing, starkly industrial process, taking up monumental amounts of space and generating a dissonant cascade of noise, as the documentary so pointedly foregrounded. It was both resource and temporally intensive, limiting the size of the newspaper, who could operate a newspaper, and where a paper could be based and located. More contemporary computational technology, to my mind, democratized the medium - though it may have purged the workforce, some of whom seemed greatly attached to the old processes and there soon-to-be obsolete positions.
