McKenzie's article really resonated with me in its insistence that bibliography "cannot exclude from its own proper concerns the relation between form, function, and symbolic meaning." I myself hope to investigate just this interaction in my research work. McKenzie also emphasizes the importance of paying attention to historical processes of book creation and circulation, much as we have done in this class, as part of the bibliographic effort, moving scholars toward a better understanding of human "motives and interactions" surrounding texts. The materiality and reproduction of the book is of vital importance to his bibliographic approach, as both can be used to try to understand how texts have been read. In this sense, historical and productive context should be used not to determine what a book "means" but, again, how it is read. I found McKenzie's analysis of the Congreve quote to be interesting, but lacking, in that I don't think it adequately fleshed out all of the dynamics he is hinting at in his theoretical sections, instead focusing almost only on the textual differences, rather than other material and even historical dynamics.

Cordell's claim that it is vital to pay attention to and investigate the social processes and levels of mediation and remediation that go into digital editions of texts resonated with me. In my work with the WWP, I myself have encountered many instances where a pure OCR transcription would surely have faltered. I have also encountered characteristics of the texts, such as illustrations, that would only be encodable in a searchable database if one were to go back to an earlier level of metadata and encode that detail manually. My work with the WWP also resonated in terms of the vital importance of encoding texts in the first place, but perhaps more-so, the priority that digitized and encoded texts receive in academia. The study showing that digitized newspapers were cited disproportionately more than non-digitized ones was an eye-opener for me, emphasizing both the power of digitization for opening up the discourse and realms of knowledge (as the WWP does) but also the pervasive blindness of certain historical moments, communities, movements, and mindsets that the academy is heading towards if we are not cognizant of the ways in which we are favoring archival sources that are convenient rather than those that are most relevant, underrepresented, or useful. This dynamic emphasizes the vital importance of digital archival projects in a way I had not really considered previously.

When comparing different versions of Blake's "The Tyger," I was struck by the difference illustration and color makes to the meaning and reception of the poem. One version I picked is saturated in bright yellow, amplifying the "burning bright" of the tiger, whose face is lit as if by fire, adding a narrative dimension to the illustration. Another image I picked cast the tiger in darkness, giving it a menacing mood. Its body is rendered in black and red hues, suggesting a capacity for violence. In contrast to the prior version, this edition seems to emphasize the "fearful" elements of the poem - the brightness simply is not there. In stark contrast to this dark Tyger is the third edition I picked, wherein the poem is backlit by a violet sky and the tiger, painted in friendly orange hues, wears a pleasant, non-threatening grin on his face. Even though this tiger is clearly based on the exact same outline as the other two, the soft pastels, clear (rather than obscured) line and lighting, and green grass on which he seems to gently tread grants him a much more friendly air. 

I was struck by many similar axes of change looking at versions of "London." However, some new dynamics emerged as well. One of the three I selected was written or printed with thick, dark strokes that make some of the text more difficult to discern and give the illustration a rougher quality, making it seem more "antique," like a relic from a past time. Another I selected seemed to be reprinted in a smaller format that the other two instantiations, making it more difficult to read the text, and reducing the power of the flourishes and details of the penmanship and illustration. The first edition I selected, by contrast, presents both illustration and text clearly, against a blue/uncolored gradient background, that, connected with the old man's long beard, gives the poem an almost mystical quality.

In both the case of Tyger, and London, which had similar dynamics of coloration impacting meaning and reception, I was left wondering, in a manner similar to Cordell's discussion of OCR, to what degree different means and conditions of digital remediation led to the characteristics I observe in each edition. Clearly, the differences in color and style pre-exist the remediation of these works. But have the hues changed? Would the contrast between the letters and the page be more or less pronounced in a physical format? A digital approximation is (much) better than nothing, to be sure, but there is not real way to answer these questions without a trip to the archive.

Eve's discussion of the differences between the US and UK editions of *Cloud Atlas* is fascinating, but I found myself wishing for more insight into the theoretical ramifications of the destabilization of the initial text. He clearly articulates how actual authorial or "writer" based dynamics can influence a circulated text as much as any sort of digital remediation can, but I wish he could have connected his discussion to hyper-changing digital forms like live updating news articles which continually are edited and taken up in new mediums. It is fascinating to consider the divergent takes of *Cloud Atlas* made possible by the divergent editions, and even moreso, the vast amount of change that occurs as a result of oft-obscured editing processes. I also think issues of copyright are also quite significant for the analysis of contemporary literature. In my field, the reproduction of images for scholarly work can be tricky to negotiate, but is also incredibly vital, as the image is the root of the analysis and cannot be replicated in text.
