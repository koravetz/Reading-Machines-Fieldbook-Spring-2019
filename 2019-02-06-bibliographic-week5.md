Marcy Dinius's "Press" provides a succint overview of the role and power of press during the 1700s and early 1800s. The press at that time was often devised rhetorically in its material instantiation, seen as a weapon by both abolitionists and slave-holders when it came to their cause. This perspective comes with good reason, as the press truly was the means for instantiating and sustaining social change. Further, Dinius highlights the treatment of the press in human terms, and how, in granting "freedom of the press," the Constitution gave more freedom to a machine than to an entire race of people. This notion of a mechanism with power meant that many black leaders of the time were unwilling to rally around a singular national pass that would, symbolically and practically, mean ceding their power to a machine. For the machine, just as much as the text that came from it, had and has power, whether for good or evil, though power from human hands, as Garrison's final quote emphasizes. It's important to note the role that technologies play in allowing a text to exist in the first place, particularly in ecosystems where such technologies are limited. 

Borsuk's chapter "The Book as Content" details how the book as object came to be perceived invisibly in our modern day, telling a lengthy history of the evolution of the book form and format. This invisibility is both despite and because of the fact that many (if not all) facets of the book we take for granted today were developed consciously. The last 500 years of book production, starting with the printing press, saw a turn from the book format being designed for the convenience and use of the printer, to being designed for consumption by the audience. In some cases, these design choices are linked to ease of reading, with things like tables of contents, regular type faces, and spacing in Penguin Books enabling the content of books to be quickly and transparently digested (not to mention foregrounded). In other cases, book design choices are linked to commodification, as books became both objects of display, and objects aligned for sale to support booth publishers pressing reprints and authors with new ownership of their texts thanks to the advent of copyright law. Throughout these processes, the format and form of the book has been a constantly developing process designed to entice readers, enable successful production strategies, spread information, and, in contemporary processes, make invisible the book itself. I was left wondering whether the book is still wholly invisible. While this is certainly true in many if not most cases, a notable number of books are growing to rely more on a tangible experience of their object-hood as the media environment becomes diversified, as the Aestheticization of Bookishness reading pointed out. That said, contemporary book designs are wholly oriented toward making  their contents accessible, understandable, and impactful, a far cry from the days of outward-facing fore-edges in small collections.
