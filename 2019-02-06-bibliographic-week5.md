Marcy Dinius's "Press" provides a succint overview of the role and power of press during the 1700s and early 1800s. The press at that time was often devised rhetorically in its material instantiation, seen as a weapon by both abolitionists and slave-holders when it came to their cause. This perspective comes with good reason, as the press truly was the means for instantiating and sustaining social change. Further, Dinius highlights the treatment of the press in human terms, and how, in granting "freedom of the press," the Constitution gave more freedom to a machine than to an entire race of people. This notion of a mechanism with power meant that many black leaders of the time were unwilling to rally around a singular national pass that would, symbolically and practically, mean ceding their power to a machine. For the machine, just as much as the text that came from it, had and has power, whether for good or evil, though power from human hands, as Garrison's final quote emphasizes. It's important to note the role that technologies play in allowing a text to exist in the first place, particularly in ecosystems where such technologies are limited. 

Borsuk's chapter "The Book as Content" details how the book as object came to be perceived invisibly in our modern day, telling a lengthy history of the evolution of the book form and format. This invisibility is both despite and because of the fact that many (if not all) facets of the book we take for granted today were developed consciously. The last 500 years of book production, starting with the printing press, saw a turn from the book format being designed for the convenience and use of the printer, to being designed for consumption by the audience. In some cases, these design choices are linked to ease of reading, with things like tables of contents, regular type faces, and spacing in Penguin Books enabling the content of books to be quickly and transparently digested (not to mention foregrounded). In other cases, book design choices are linked to commodification, as books became both objects of display, and objects aligned for sale to support booth publishers pressing reprints and authors with new ownership of their texts thanks to the advent of copyright law. Throughout these processes, the format and form of the book has been a constantly developing process designed to entice readers, enable successful production strategies, spread information, and, in contemporary processes, make invisible the book itself. I was left wondering whether the book is still wholly invisible. While this is certainly true in many if not most cases, a notable number of books are growing to rely more on a tangible experience of their object-hood as the media environment becomes diversified, as the Aestheticization of Bookishness reading pointed out. That said, contemporary book designs are wholly oriented toward making  their contents accessible, understandable, and impactful, a far cry from the days of outward-facing fore-edges in small collections.

Gitelman's"Print Culture (Other Than Codex)" is a delightfully written overview of how the concept of "print culture" can be complicated by looking into non-codex printed materials. Doing so reveals that thinking of print culture in terms of publisher, author, and even reader is fallacious, as many of the ephemeral documents printed by printers past and present do not operate within such frameworks. I found this notion of inscribing a term or construct onto the past, the way scholars have done with print culture, to be linked with issues of naming past thinkers as, say, feminists. How can we justify placing something or someone in a framework that did not exist at the time of its creation? Thus, Gitelman's call for historical and subject specificity for media forms make sense. Still, I think Gitelman goes too far in declaring that noncodex forms do not produce selves or "inspire identification among communities" (192). Things like concert tickets, event posters, and stock notices create identities and communities through both their textual and material instantiations, playing key roles in networks of activity that foster certain communities, from fan bases to stockbrokers. 

The selected chapters from Ben Franklin's *Autobiography* painted a charming and fascinating picture both of the founding father and American literary life in his time. In particular, I was struck by the economy with which printing was associated, in that regions had only a certain demand for a certain number of printers, which in turn suggests a limit to the information circulated through those areas. The quality of the printer, and his employees, may also have limited said information. I also found it interesting (and sensible) how printers like Franklin printed some of their own work on the side. For Franklin, this turned out to be a significant advantage, allowing him to jumpstart his news-press against his competitions other paper products. It's also interesting to think about the vast endeavor it must have been to get printing supplies from Europe, for, as Franklin notes, such supplies were not made in America. This too would have limited the type and quantity of information that could proliferate, and indeed any civic or social function reliant on printing. 

Blair's Introduction to *Too Much To Know* provides an overview of the form and function of Early Modern reference materials. I found it interesting that she claims "information overload" is a term with resonances throughout the ages; as she implies, each age has felt itself overloaded with information. However, she also mentions great thinkers' lust for information, which took the form of extensive notes and comments to create such information in the first place, which others found in reference books, which, unlike other printed books, routinely sold well and were regularly consulted or read. To me this stands in contrast with information overload in the present sense, where the great deluge of information has prompted some to try and shut themselves out of the information flow, rather than to drink deeply from it, or even contribute to it themselves, as these Early Modern thinkers did. Another important takeaway from the article is the idea of the 4 S's of text management: storage, selecting, sorting, and summarizing, practices conducted both then and now. Fruitful research work is to be done analyzing the way these 4 S's management in different forms of reference technology, past and present.
