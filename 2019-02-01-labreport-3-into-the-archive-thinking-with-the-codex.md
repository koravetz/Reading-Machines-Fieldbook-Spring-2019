For this lab, I will begin by comparing two spreads from the “Dragon Prayer Book” (henceforth DPB) (after 1461) and Ovid’s P. Ovidii Nasoni Amatoria ( henceforth Ovid). The DPB is a handwritten text written on parchment, containing ornamented prayers, including musical accompaniment or performance of some prayers. The pages I selected highlight many of its key features: the ornate blue and red capitals, the illustrated margins, the drawn musical notation, the gothic lettering, the guiding lines upon which the text is written, and the quality of the parchment itself. The book’s many decorative qualities, its length, and its status as a handwritten object in a time concurrent with print, indicate its tremendous value, suggesting it may have been a private prayer book for a wealthy patron. In this latter sense the book is evidence for the notion that medias do not suddenly die and are replaced, but that there is a gradual shift between formats as the old lingers, or even remains in a niche. Enmeshed within the pages of the DPB, elements like writing lines helped the scribe initially write the text within, while tabs help the reader flip to particular passages - each an element suggesting the book’s focus on making the work of both creator and reader easier, in some ways an early portent of the reader-friendly formal decisions that would come to dominate much later texts, as Borsuk discusses.

Ovid’s text, while set in print rather than handwritten, still contains many similarities to the DPB, indicating the way familiar book tropes enable the transition from older to newer formats. Guiding lines appear on the sides of the page, and certain letters retain the decorative flourish of the DPB’s, perhaps out of a desire to present the Ovid as a more luxurious book than its printing (and likely pricing) would suggest. I say likely pricing because the Ovid text certainly was less expensive and exclusive than the DPB, and aimed at a different, or at least additional, class or classes of reader. Ovid’s text is printed on cheaper paper, whose processes are clearly visible with the naked eye, incorporating an amalgamative and egalitarian “paper nationalism” through its composition from diversely classed sources, while the DPB’s parchment, requiring a large investment in livestock, suggests a more exclusive audience and refined frame. The printing process required for Ovid’s text also calls for additional markers to assist the printer. Signature marks demarcate which portion of the octavo-folded sheet each codex page must be printed upon. The DPB lacks such marks, and when it has page numbers, they are clearly written in by a later audience, rather than by the scribe, in contrast to Ovid’s text, where the page numbers were printed alongside the book’s other text. Thinking back to the DPB’s guiding lines and tabs, however, each book has devices meant to aid manufacture and reading, devices fitting to each book’s format and production. That said, the Ovid, with its italic font, is much more eminently readable than the DPB, which may have served a decorative, “showy,” purpose for its elite owners as much as it may have been actually read. 

Andreas Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543) strikes an interesting middle ground between these two books. On one level, like the DPB, the Fabrica is clearly designed for a wealthy, upper class owner (or institution). Its folio printing, while accommodating intricately detailed illustrations of the human body, also demanded plentiful lighting and a large reading surface, both difficult to come by for those of lesser means. The Fabrica also contains decorative, lavishly illustrated letters that do not assist in its educational function (unlike the body diagrams) but, like the colored letters in the DPB, instead signal to its luxuriant qualities. In some senses, the high cost of replicating and creating the Fabrica, in part established through these design choices, would have kept the knowledge contained inside relatively exclusive in a power move by both the printer and buyers of the text.

The Fabrica, however, also has many similarities to Ovid’s text. It also contains printed text, that, while written in roman rather than italic font, is designed to be first and foremost read, rather than appreciated. This emphasis on reading is heightened by the marginal notes signaling sections of interest for scholars, the headings at the top of the pages, and the catchwords at the bottom of the pages, each designed to facilitate more productive reading. And yet, as detailed in the preceding paragraph, the Fabrica is clearly decorative as well as functional, striking an interesting balance between the two realms. While I believe it is printed on paper like the Ovid text, the Fabrica’s paper appears to be of a higher quality, as its lineation is not visible. Overall, the Fabrica contains both the luxury of the DPB and the print-permitted practicality of Ovid’s text in one large package designed for both conscious reading and intellectual awe by upper class audiences.
