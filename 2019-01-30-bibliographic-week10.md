McGann's "Textual Condition" is a mind-trip of a piece, enacting its theories and its processes of composition in its whirling narrative structure. McGann foregrounds his processes of composition in a way that makes readers hyperaware of the fragmented, mediated nature of his work. His reference to dates and times sets the text in a particular temporal context jarring to our own, establishing its relativism explicitly, establishing its datedness explicitly as it situates itself in a continual process of change and, ultimately, resigned stability as new packets of information enter into the picture. In other words, the text practices what McGann preaches in his so-called "definitive statements," to such a degree that at times it reads as a whirlwind. To me, this signals the limits to which one can truly enact awareness of the conditions of composition and production in the text that is being composed and produced itself. Attention to every moment and detail of composition means displacing the ideas one wants to make, or burying them under a cavalcade of detail that is paradoxically both vital and extraneous. One must strike a balance between context of assertions and assertions themselves - something also foregrounded in feminist academic writing practices.

I was honestly a little underwhelmed by Shep's article on early emojis and emoji history; though it was neat seeing historical examples of early personified punctuation, I feel like the "Dude" presented in class served as just as strong an evidence for early emojis (or at least ASCII art) as Shep's examples did. In some cases, I found Shep opened the door for further analysis, but didn't actually go there. For instance, how are emojis punctuative - rather that punctuation only being "emoji-ative?" It seems to me that their relationship could be considered more explicitly dialectically, and not just evolutionarily from one to the other. Further, what does it mean that early emojis, both in print and digital, were used for humor, rather than for other emotional valences? Does the experience of emoji viewing elicit an immediate humorous reaction because of the cognitive distance between text and image, or image of a human face and the actual human face of the viewer? I'm definitely not talking about Shep's discussion of the visual qualities of punctuation marks borrowed from Adorno - I honestly found that to be overreaching, romantic hogwash.

I found Denis Tenen's "Introduction" to computational poetics fascinating and extremely insightful, particularly considering how he took the notions of exteriority first conceived of by immigrant theorists and applied to them a discussion of the material qualities of digital text objects that are invested with or tool of varieties of power. I had previously thought of digital mediation and hardware in terms of constraint and expansion/enablement, but had not connected those dynamics to capitalist or state power as directly or lucidly as Tenen does. I wholeheartedly agree then that we must pay attention to material factors, not only in how they shape our reading experiences, but in how they shape our positions within the power systems they create. This is a challenge when, as Tenen makes clear, we are so habituated to our technological lives, to the point of almost being cyborgs. Cutting deep can require expertise, but I feel like there is still potential for a critical understanding of these technologies without an engineering-level understanding of how they function precisely. Digging too deeply into that engineering field, as Tenen himself comments, can indeed lead to a sort of terministic screen created by that discourse community.

Denen's chapter on "Metaphor Machines" was similarly interesting, carrying forward his discussion of obscuring and habituation mediation processes that rob users of the ability to critically investigate the power structures embedded in those medias. Key in the chapter was the idea of the faulty metaphor, or the hypermetaphor, o the desimulation. Denen argues that directly representative computer systems, rather than relying on metaphors that actually connect to a referent, come only to refer to themselves, as a fictional map would refer only to its own decisions, rather than a true geography. In this sense, while users think that putting a document in a digital trash can actually throws it away, that is not the case. This deception has a large impact on how we perceive and interact with the world, and how we are subjects of systems of computational power that are not readily apparent to the eye. It emphasizes the importance of investigating digital systems for what they really are, rather than what they appear to be, or at the very least, to treat the surfaces of digital systems as just that, surfaces, rather than material realities. 

Raley's chapter on "TXTual Practice" was both intriguing and dense. I appreciated her closing call for humanists to pay attention to the ephemeral present, and I see how her attention to systemic and practice-oriented readings could allow us to do so. I also appreciated her call to look beyond the deep materiality of the object (somewhat, but definitely not entirely in contrast to Denen). There is a value in looking at the surface of an interface in the context of its context and its interaction with users; investigating encounters with texts as events, and not as objects previously in  isolated existence. The ephemerality of the displays that Raley focuses on necessitates this form of scholarly engagement. I was additionally intrigued by Raley's comments on the relative nature of our textual engagements. One line in particular stood out to me: "Our so-called distracted reading is thus only such in relation to
the conventional symbolic structures beyond which we are conditioning
ourselves to move." What we consider to be "distracted," "messy," or "unintuitive" we do consider as such through the lens of our prior mediated encounters that we are moving beyond through sustained interaction with new media forms. Habituated in these new forms, they come the new standard.
