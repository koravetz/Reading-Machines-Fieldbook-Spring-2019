Prior to this lab, I had assumed that returning to composing text would be intuitive, that it would be simple to pick up and resume. However, my confidence was misplaced, as I initially set my type in the wrong orientation, regularly confused my "b"s and "d"s, ran out of sorts because I agreed to share a case with another compositor, and found my passage taking far longer to compose than I anticipated. Each of these experiences revised my understanding of the labor of composing, particularly when paired with recent readings.

Firstly, I assumed that orientation and letter distinction would be non-issues, that I would be readily able to reorient my mind to new directions of reading and composing. However, I was entirely wrong, and had to check myself throughout that I was following proper processes and orientations. This mandate to check and this difficulty in seeing the world in a new way helped me understand the framing of compositing as a skill and career that was so prevalent in both the occupational videos and women's printing texts that we read. I hubristically saw those activities as simple (probably through a historically primitivizing lens) when they actually, like those texts described, require a re-thinking and re-orientation of text itself. In this sense, it may have been easier at times to compose and not know how to read very well, and to engage with the sorts as a pattern of empty signs to be copied, rather than a series of letters arranged in an unfamiliar and thus confusing arrangement.

Secondly, I assumed that I would have plenty of sorts to complete my passage, but ran out, in part because I shared the case with another compiler - though I feel like I would have run out regardless. This experience reiforced the material power dynamics at play in printing that we read about a few weeks ago. A lack of printing supplies in America, as Franklin bemoaned, meant a physical and temporal inability to reproduce texts quickly, easily, and efficiently, as a limited amount of text would be able to be composed at a time, as dictated by the number of available sorts. As these sorts were made in England, in a large sense written discourse in America was limited by the intercontinental trade of sorts themselves. My lack of sorts also amplified the conception of the printing press object (and its accouterments) as a source of power in and of itself, as the history of black printing emphasizes. There is nothing more limiting to a discourse than a lack of printing materials. However, the presence of certain printing materials also makes room for the creation of a new discourse gap as the constraints of the printing system come to dictate oral discourse, which, in its desire to be printable, accommodates itself to the material bounds (power?) of the press.

Finally, I assumed that I would have time to compose my paragraph-length passage when, in reality, I was only able to compose roughly half of it. Of course, a good chunk of this time was devoted to fixing my aforementioned mistakes, but there was also an inherent amount of time spent transferring letters from case to composing stick and from composing stick to galley. I was, of course, not the quickest, and I see why, gendered as those claims were, nimble fingers were valued in the composing room. Yet, composing dictates a much vaster amount of time than does typing or handwriting, reinforcing, for me, just how valuable books and writing in general was in the days of printed matter. Circulated, typed or printed writing in our current idiom does not convey in its connotations any sort of material value, particularly in an era when computers can compose. In the era of printing, however, the lengthier the document, the more valuable the contents, not only by virtue of the intellectual challenge of length, but the material challenge therein.
