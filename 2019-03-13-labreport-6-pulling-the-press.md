Completing the full printing process has reshaped my understanding of early printing creation processes and products to a large degree. For starters, I initially conceived of folio-sized books as being more difficult to create than their smaller octavo brethren. This perception stemmed from the high page material cost and restrictively luxuriant reading requirements that accompanied folio texts at the time of their creation, as opposed to the lower requirements of smaller texts. However, it now seems to me that these larger texts would not necessarily be more difficult to create, but rather, have different demands. Ornamentation likely played a larger role in most of these large texts by virtue of their large size providing space for ornamentation at all; smaller page sizes would prevent ornate, detailed displays, limited as they would be by font sizing. Only skilled printers could set these folio sized ornaments quickly and accurately, as spacing them evenly on the page requires both finesse and familiarity with tools beyond alphanumeric sorts. In this sense, folio frontispieces and illustrations may have proven difficult to print. I ran into this issue with my own work, as a few of my spacers fell out in transition on the press as a result of my inexperience with arranging and affixing text on large composing surfaces. 

However, folios are also printed with two pages on a single sheet of paper, rather than an octavo’s eight. Thus, it is much more straightforward to lay out folio pages than it is to lay out octavo pages. Octavo printing requires an additional step with additional room for error; arranging text in the proper order for one page on a single sheet was hard enough, let alone arranging eight pages in different alignments for non-consecutive pages on a single sheet. Printers further had to fold, cut, and arrange these printed sheets in the proper order, using far more deliberation and time than on their folio companions. It may have been that such processes became automatic with time, or that an inability to read fluently made certain compositors a better fit for octavo format printing. Regardless, these additional octavo printing processes required skilled workers - in this sense, they may have been more difficult to complete than folio editions.

The fact that these two formats each come with their own printing challenges leads me to have more respect for smaller editions from the early days of printing. Folio books, on their face, present a grandiosity that suggests great craftsmanship and artistry - and this is certainly true. However, smaller books evince a similar degree of skill. It is not necessarily the talent level of the craftsman that dictates their less-showy designs, but rather their functionality and positioning in the cultural sphere. 

However, each of these codices, and in fact all codices, were much more difficult to print than single page leaflets, broadsides, notices, etc. I knew this fact before, but the embodied process of printing made this far more evident to me, as I was able to quickly print one page repeatedly, but switching out which plate was being printed was a time consuming process. The press can only print one page at a time. Book pages would therefore be produced en masse in sets of one to sixteen pages per sheet, and which would then have to be ordered, cut, and bound. Conversely, leaflets etc. fit to the single-sheet technological demands of the press, meaning they can be produced more cheaply, more quickly, and with less labor. Early newspapers may have also fit this paradigm, with their large size not requiring any sort of page arrangement on sheets, and their lack of binding expediting their distribution. It’s likely that their format is a response to the necessity of this quick distribution in response to the news of the day. The large size of newspaper pages would have limited the number of new plates that would have had to have been made, reducing composing, organizing, and plate-replacement time, in addition to serving as a nice advertisement for the paper itself by virtue of its auspiciousness.

Regardless of format or size, printing required and requires physical exertion and rhythm to do properly. Operating the press required both a strong initial push and continuing state of flow. It made me cognizant of the degree to which printing was a mass industrial process, as many of our course authors have alluded to. It's interesting to me how much we now romanticize the activity, when for many, it was likely a physical demanding living. Printing large runs of text would have required both burl and dexterity, demanding quick hands and constant attention. When we are able to dip our toe in, this activity is novel, and insightful. For those in the past, it may have been a bit more a literal pain in the behind.
